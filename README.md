# neurotech_task_1
SNP analysis using a reference chromosome and segments of two other versions of it.

# things this does 
This project performs Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis using Python.  
It compares sample DNA sequences against a reference to generate:
- **SNP frequency matrices**
- **SNP distribution plots**
- **Transition/Transversion ratio**

# files
- `bio1.py` → main analysis script  
- `sample1.fasta`, `sample2.fasta`, `ref.fasta` → input sequence files

# you need
- Biopython  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Tabulate

# how to Run
